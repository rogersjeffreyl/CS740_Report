\section{Conclusion and Future work}\label{sec:conclusions}
In our analysis, we observed that WideTable outperforms other views considered in the 
study.
The better performance was unaffected by the multiple memory configurations we tested 
in our analysis. 

A major takeaway in our analysis is that the cost of workload is affected significantly by 
the disk access patterns. 
Therefore the cost formulation should incorporate not just the buffer pool memory but 
also query characteristics such as types of joins, I/O access patterns, disk bandwidth etc. 
A sophisticated cost model involving the above parameters can help us in a more 
accurate modeling of the workload. 

We also feel that SSB is a simple benchmark which doesn't offer variety in terms of 
relational operations performed in the query. 
A complex benchmark like TPC-H should offer more challenges in analysis. 

Lastly, the LP formulation should allow selection of multiple views, instead of one view 
per workload, as it is assumed right now. 
This will allow us to choose the best view for a given query and potentially maximizing 
the performance gain for the workload. 
It will also make the LP not so obvious, unlike the current LP which can be solved using a 
simple greedy algorithm.
